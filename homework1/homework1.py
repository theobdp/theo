a = 10
print(a)
print(type(a))
#int, which is basically just an integer value

b = 1.5
print(b)
print(type(b))
#float, which is a number with a decimal point

c = 3j
print(c)
print(type(c))
#complex, which is a complex number where the j represents the imaginary component

d = "hello"
print(d)
print(type(d))
#string, which is a word or text

e = [1,2,3]
print(e)

#list, collection of items that you can move around

f = {"name": "Ellen", "favorite fruit": "strawberry"}
print(f)
print(type(f))
#dict, collection of pairs that are like keys for each other

g = (1,2)
print(g)

#like a list, but you can't move the items around

h = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry"]
print(h)
print(type(h))
#list, but with different data types as the items

i = True
print(i)
print(type(i))

j = None
print(j)
print(type(j))
#NoneType, which is basically an N/A

k = [True, "blue", 12]
print(k)
print(type(k))
#list, but you can use different data types in one list

l = str(14)
print(l)
print(type(l))
#string, the string version of 14. basically l is "14"

m = 1e4
print(m)
print(type(m))
#float, this is scientific notation and it seems to default to being a float
